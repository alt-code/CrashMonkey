*Theres no Monkey business here!*

Ever thought writing test cases in Javascript is hard? Ever gotten so frustrated with all the names of beverages masquerading as test frameworks which require as much effort to write test cases in as the code itself !?

*Well let me tell you writing an engine which creates automated test cases for you for these test frameworks is even harder!*
But that's what this research project is about. The intention of this project is to develop intelligence around automated test case generation using commit history, static analysis and existing test cases.
